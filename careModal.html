                We use only the very best vegetable tanned and aniline dyed leather because it is superior quality and the most sustainable leather. Our preference is for natural and full grain leather that has been tanned to express the true expression of the material. Each hide is unique and will inevitably have small defects and markings that help build the character of the piece. Whilst the leather is checked and graded for quality and appearance both at the tannery and then again at our workshop they will never be perfect because they are natural materials that have not been subjected to aggressive processing or finishing
                  
                  This leather develops a patina over time with general use. As with many natural materials the leather will be especially affected by UV light and exposure to liquid. The lighter the leather the more susceptible it will be to these factors. 
                  Our leathers are relatively unfinished and as a result are easily impressionable. Marks can be buffed back and dents can be largely rubbed out as can scuffs. These will become part of the piece and will contribute to its character.
                  If the leather is looking or too feeling dry, we recommend a neutral leather cream or balm such as carnauba cream. General use that does not damage the leather will enhance the appearance and feel of the leather over time.
                  
                  Oak bark tanned bridle leather is a very unique material. It takes over 12 months to tan and finish each piece, producing a leather that is incredibly strong and durable with a wonderfully soft finish and handle. A mix of natural waxes and oils are applied into the leather during the tanning process. These waxes often come to the fore with temperature change; this is called ‘bloom’ and looks like white or translucent clouding. Bloom will often occur during shipment, especially by air which is very cold. It is a hallmark of the best hand made leathers. To get the leather back to the original colour you just need to buff out the bloom with a medium stiff brush and dry microfibre or cotton cloth. After a little while this effect will go away entirely.
                  
                  Leather can be dusted or vacuumed or wiped with a lint free cloth. Any spillages can be contained or mitigated by wiping the whole affected panel(s) with a very lightly damp cloth and then left to dry. When dry, apply a neutral leather cream or balm to the whole panel then buff back.

                  <p stye="float:left"> 
                  Our furniture celebrates the natural beauty of wild grained native timbers. We tend to showcase them by putting the frame work on the outside of the pieces. As such it should be maintained and protected from certain variables such as light and heat. If possible keep the pieces away from direct sunlight, or open heat sources such as fireplaces or radiators to prevent the timber from cracking or warping. 
                  We finish all of our furniture with either a plant-based bio-oil and wax or natural Danish oil as they bring out the beauty of the grain and are easy to maintain. They can be wiped with a cloth or dusted with a small vacuum with a brush head. Any scuffs can be sanded and the finish reapplied.

                  <p stye="float:left">              
                  We recommend cleaning regularly to maintain the fabric and keep it looking its best. Use an upholstery or soft bristle brush or vacuum with a brush head attachment. All cushion covers can be machine washed cold but we recommend dry cleaning for a more reliable outcome. Keep dyed fabrics out of direct sunlight to prevent discolouring.
